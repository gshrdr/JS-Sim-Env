# JS-Sim-Env
A JavaScript Browser Simulation Game Environment.

**This is my current project and it is a work in progress, this project was started 04/10/2022 - expect to see updates, more information, and a live code demo in the coming weeks.**

This project is a part of my website & portfolio: [gavinshr.com](https://gavinshr.com)  

## Live Demo
You can run this code live in your browser here: [JS-Sim-Env Live Demo](https://gavinshr.com/MazeAlgorithm/index.html)  
^^ Note: This link isn't active yet - This will work once my code is fully finished & published, for the time being this just pulls up my existing JavaScript maze algorithm demo on my website.
